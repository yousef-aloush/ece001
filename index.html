        <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
        <p>is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals,
            which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed 
            by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as artificial general intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural'
            intelligence have been called artificial biological intelligence (ABI).Leading AI textbooks define the field as 
            the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of
            successfully achieving its goals.Colloquially,the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic
            "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

        <p>Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes
           actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as 
           a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data,and to use those learnings to achieve specific
           goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.
